        "abstract": "Banking is about making profits and spirituality is about giving. Rajita Kulkarni Bagga has managed to grow successfully in both these seemingly opposite aspects of her life. Her close association with one of the most renowned spiritual masters of our time, Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, brought her in touch with world leaders, presented her with incredible opportunities, and also placed new challenges on her path. She even came within perilous touching distance of armed terrorists on a killing spree, during the 26/11 attack on the Taj Hotel in Mumbai. Her book forces you to ponder if there is a force that orchestrates the events in our life and whether the way we respond to situations changes our destiny. Now, as one of Indiaâ€™s highly respected women educators, she asks, 'What is The Unknown Edge that separates the mystical from the mundane, the life-transforming from the life-threatening and the ethereal from the earthly'?",
